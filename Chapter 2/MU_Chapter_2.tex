$\textbf{E}[X]=\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^ki\right)/k=(k+1)/2$.
\section*{2.2}
The probability to type "proof" is $1/26^5$. As there are $1,000,000-5+1=999,996$ positions to start the word "proof", the desired probability would be $999996/26^5$ by the linearity of expectations.
\section*{2.3}
Take $f$ as $f(x)=-x^2$ and $X$ as a random variable with $\Pr(X=1)=\Pr(X=2)=1/2$. Then, $-5/2=\textbf{E}[f(X)]<f(\textbf{E}[X])=-9/4$.\\
Take $f$ as $f(x)=x$ and $X$ as above. Then, $\textbf{E}[f(X)]=f(\textbf{E}[X])=3/2$.\\
Take $f$ as $f(x)=x^2$ and $X$ as above. Then, $9/4=f(\textbf{E}[X])<\textbf{E}[f(X)]=5/2$.
