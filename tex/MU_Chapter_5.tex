\section*{5.1}
As $(1+1/n)^n$ increases, we find the smallest $n$ to reach the threshold.\\
$(1+1/n)^n$ first reaches $0.99e$ at $n=50$, and $0.999999e$ at $n=499982$.\\
Since $(1-1/n)^n$ also increases, we solve in a similar way. $(1-1/n)^n$ first reaches $0.99/e$ at $n=51$ and $0.999999/e$ at $n=499991$.
